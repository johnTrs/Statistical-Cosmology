# Statistical inference for cosmological model parameters 
## National Observatory of Athens Internship

**Parameters** :

- **The Hubble parameter H** is defined as the ratio of the recession velocity of a galaxy to its distance from us, expressed in units of kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc)
- **Ω_Λ and Ω_m**  the densities of dark energy and matter relative to the critical density
